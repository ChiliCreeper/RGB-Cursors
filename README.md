# RGB-Cursors
Download data associated with my RGB Cursor Pack for Windows 10
A month or two ago I decided to spice up my computer by customizing nearly everything I could. Upon realizing I could upload custom cursors, I went to go download an animated RGB pack that was the regular Windows 10 Cursors but RGB-ified. Simple request, except I couldn't find what I was looking for. The only RGB cursors I found were complex and not even close to the Windows 10 Default style.

So I decided to make my own. After many hours using a program called RealWorld Cursor Editor, I created an animated version of each of the cursors you could change in the Windows Control Panel. Same style as the Windows 10 Default, but fully colored, remade, and animated with up to 27 frames of different colors for select cursors. All the information and instructions can be found within the folder, but I'll them here too.

Installation Directions

Download this pack and move it into your cursors folder (SSD --> Windows --> Cursors)

Open the windows control panel (not settings, the actual app)

Navigate to mouse settings, then select the Pointers tab

Select Normal Select, then either double click it or press browse

Navigate back to the cursors folder where the RGB pack is

Open the RGB pack and select the normal_select_rgb file (all files are named according to the mouse properties list)

Repeat steps 4-6 for the other options, then press apply

Click Save As, then name the new pointer scheme. This creates a new scheme, so the default one is not messed up, and can always be selected if you want to go back.

Enjoy using this RGB pack!
